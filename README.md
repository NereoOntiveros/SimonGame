# SimonGame
A game modeled off the popular game Simon, using jQuery.
The way that it works is that the user can press any key to start and it will show a tile that the user has to click on to follow a pattern:

Firstly the game shows the first color in the sequence (lets say blue).
The user clicks the blue color.

Next, the game shows the next color (lets say red), the user has to remember the sequence is
blue, red and so on.

If the user messes up the sequence the game ends.
